### Q & A:

 - Where is my save data?
	 - Your save data can be located at: _C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local\Twig_
	 - Because this is a very unstable thing as of now things can go south at any time, so a __Backups_ folder is located at the same directory, and it is updated each time you save.
 - How do I make a branching path?
	 - You just simply have to create a second dialog box coming from a dialog box that already has one path.
	 - For two branching paths, the options "Yes" and "No" are automatically added for your convenience, but you can always edit them.
